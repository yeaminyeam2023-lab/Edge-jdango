Step 1: Stop the Running Server
If your Django development server is already running, stop it by pressing:
Step 2: Run the Server on Port 8080
From the terminal, make sure you are in the project directory (where manage.py is located), then run:
python manage.py runserver 8080
Django will now start the development server on port 8080.
You should see output similar to this:
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks
System check identified no issues 

Django version 5.x.x, using settings 'myfirstproject.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
Step 3: Open in Browser
Open your web browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
You will see the message:
Welcome to Django!
This confirms that your Django project is running successfully on port 8080.
